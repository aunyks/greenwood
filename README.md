# greenwood

A plug-and-play automated trading framework.

## What is it?

Greenwood is a Python framework that makes automated trading simpler in practice.

## Why Greenwood?

Many automated trading implementations are built "with free hand" and don't abide by a generalized framework that's easy to read and write. Greenwood aims to augment automated trading solutions by providing developers with a series of simple, scalable interfaces and utilities for defining trading activity.
